The “One Student One Chip” (OSOC) initiative was launched by the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2019. The initiative guides students through designing a RISC-V processor chip from scratch, including tape-out, developing a simple operating system, running it on the chip, running the real game Legend of Sword and Fairy, and completing the physical design process using open-source EDA tools. This enables students to understand the entire processor chip design process. As of February 2025, the total number of OSOC enrollments has exceeded 10,000. This report introduces the implementation of the “One Student One Chip” initiative and the outcomes of open-source chip talent cultivation.
